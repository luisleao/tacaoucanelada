At this time only OSX 10.8/OSX 10.9/Windows 7 has been tested. You will need at least\n\nAdd Sphero to your app:\n\n```javascript\nvar roundRobot = require('node-sphero');\nvar sphero = new roundRobot.Sphero();\n\nsphero.on('connected', function(ball) {\n  ball.setRGBLED(0, 255, 0, false);\n});\n\nsphero.connect();\n```\n\nRun that and your sphero should turn #00FF00... green.\n\nCheck out the examples for more ideas.\n\n## Installing\n\nNode Sphero relies on node-serialport to communicate with the Sphero. Node-serialport is currently compatible with Linux, OSX 10.8 and up and Windows 7 and up running Node v0.8 and up. If you have issues installing Node Sphero and the errors messages say it cannot install node-serialport. Please checkout their [installation section](https://github.com/voodootikigod/node-serialport#to-install) and then [open an issue with](https://github.com/voodootikigod/node-serialport/issues?state=open) that project.\n\n\n## In Progress\n\nThe rest of the sphero bluetooth api functionality.\n\n## Thanks\n\nAwesome work by [Bradley Meck](https://github.com/bmeck) who built the initial version.\n",
